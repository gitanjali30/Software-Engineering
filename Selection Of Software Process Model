Prototype Model

Prototype methodology is defined as a Software Development model in which a prototype is built, test, and then reworked when needed until an acceptable prototype is achieved. It also creates a base to produce the final system.

Software prototyping model works best in scenarios where the project's requirement are not known. It is an iterative, trial, and error method which take place between the developer and the client.
